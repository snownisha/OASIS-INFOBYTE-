            <p>I am Snow Nisha Amala Doss. I discovered a profound interest in software development. The necessity to streamline processes and enhance efficiency ignited my curiosity, propelling me towards exploring software solutions. Through self-directed learning in Java and Python, I dedicated myself to honing my coding skills. This journey not only equipped me with the ability to write efficient and scalable code but also exposed a genuine passion for software development. I am now eager to channel this passion into contributing to innovative projects and driving impactful change.  
            Currently learning Back-End Development course from Meta. I am familiar with Python, Django (Basics), HTML5 and CSS3</p>

            <p>Dräxlmaier (Germany)</p>
            <p>From June 2023 to Jan 2024</p>
            <p>
                Focused on developing and improving estimation methods for software development projects. The ultimate goal of the thesis was to help Dräxlmaier's software team to calculate the effort more precisely for their upcoming projects. After conducting extensive research and analysis, my thesis aimed to refine the estimation process by introducing the below techniques,
                Approach 1 with Function Point Analysis and Intermediate COCOMO Model. 
                Approach 2 is a Combination of Delphi and Three point estimation. 
                and Approach 3 is a Statistical Approach using T distribution.

            <h3>Implementing a Docker and CI/CD based Web Application with a friendly and intuitive interface (Team Project)</h3>
            <p>Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany</p>
            <p>From Oct 2022 to Jan 2023</p>
            <p>It's an E-commerce Application in which we used Figma for UI/UX, React.js for Frontend, Django for Backend & CI/CD pipeline was created using github actions. 

                I was responsible for implementing the Backend functionality. My primary role was to write code and troubleshoot if any issue arises. I have implemented features like Backend Authentication using JSON Web Token (JWT), Sqlite3 database for storing users information during signup & used Djoser setup for sending mails to the users. 
                
                This project has been invaluable in helping me understand the software project workflow. It has provided me with a comprehensive overview of the entire process from planning to implementation. I have gained a better understanding of the importance of communication and collaboration between the team to make an effective project and I am now equipped better to work on software projects.</p>
